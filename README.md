## Let's get this shit going

**Q:** Why is it called "bleacho"?

**A:** Knowing me, the state of the code will become convoluted piece of cow shit sooner to the point I'd bleach out my eyes without hesitation because of my code. That's where the name comes from.

**Q:** Why is it in C++20?

**A:** My disgust and trauma in Python (also Rust, Go, Zig but the situation is unrelated) is unbelievable. I wouldn't use Python as backend in anything. I thought about ``dotnet`` but the ``HttpListener`` from it doesn't support HTTPS and ex. proxying traffic through ``cfd`` will really degrade the performance. I don't like the bloated ASP.NET too which supports HTTPS and it's probably possible to use SSL certificates too.

**Q:** Why is the license ``DBAD``?

**A:** Secret, the license will change later depending on publicity of this project.


Sorry for this language, I had a rough day today and I have nothing to let it out on
